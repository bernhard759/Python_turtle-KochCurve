# Koch Curve Fractal Grid

This Python project utilizes the Turtle module to draw a grid of Koch curve fractals. Each cell in the grid contains a Koch curve with a different order, providing a visually appealing demonstration of fractal geometry.

## Features
- Draws a grid of Koch curve fractals.
- Each fractal has a different order, showcasing varying levels of complexity.
- Background colors distinguish each fractal within the grid.
- The grid lines are not visible, ensuring focus on the fractals themselves.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Turtle module (included in standard Python installation)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or copy the Python code into a Python file.
2. Run the Python script.
3. The Turtle graphics window will open, displaying the grid of Koch curve fractals.

## Customization
- Adjust the `size` parameter in the `draw_koch_curve` function to change the size of the fractals.
- Modify the `colors` list in the `draw_grid` function to change the background colors of the fractals.

Feel free to explore, experiment, and modify the code to create your own variations of the Koch curve fractal grid!
